# SCM-Practice-Do


Software configuration management (SCM) is like a diary for a program that the programmer records what is done each time the code is changed. It is a great way to keep track of the work flow and identify the source of the bug when it appears. SCM is very helpful for projects involving multiple team members. It informs everyone about what changes have been made, improving collaboration.
